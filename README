### Quick Note

This project is a part of a learning process and it's is my first javascript
project.

### VCFConverter

I use mutt as an e-mail client and mutt uses Abook as a contact manager. Since
Abook (as far as I know) do not support the VCF format I'm creating this
javascript app to convert my VCF file to an Abook file.

### Help

Keep in mind I'm a javascript beginner :O. If you find any error or if you
know a better way of coding please, let's talk :)

### How to run it?

Soon I'm gonna change the way it works

By now: you have save your VCF file at the same directory as the script
Run: babel-node vcfConverter.js

### Is it working?

It will give you a JSON object as an output. So, no, it is not working.

### Next Steps

Convert this JSON output to the ABOOK format
